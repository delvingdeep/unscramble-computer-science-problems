# Unscramble Computer Science Problems

> This project showcases solutions to five tasks based on a fabricated set of calls and texts exchanged during September 2016. It uses Python to analyze and answer questions about the texts and calls contained in the dataset. Lastly, it also indicates run time analysis of the solutions and determines its efficiency.

## About the data
The text data `text.csv` has the following columns: sending telephone number (string), receiving telephone number (string), timestamp of text message (string).

The call data `call.csv` has the following columns: calling telephone number (string), receiving telephone number (string), start timestamp of telephone call (string), duration of telephone call in seconds (string)

All telephone numbers are 10 or 11 numerical digits long. Each telephone number starts with a code indicating the location and/or type of the telephone number. There are three different kinds of telephone numbers, each with a different format:

Fixed lines start with an area code enclosed in brackets. The area codes vary in length but always begin with 0. Example: "(022)40840621".
Mobile numbers have no parentheses, but have a space in the middle of the number to help readability. The mobile code of a mobile number is its first four digits and they always start with 7, 8 or 9. Example: "93412 66159".
Telemarketers' numbers have no parentheses or space, but start with the code 140. Example: "1402316533".

## Tasks

### Task 0
What is the first record of texts and what is the last record of calls?

Print messages:
"First record of texts, <incoming number> texts <answering number> at time <time>"
"Last record of calls, <incoming number> calls <answering number> at time <time>, lasting <during> seconds"

### Task 1
How many different telephone numbers are there in the records?

Print a message:
"There are <count> different telephone numbers in the records."

### Task 2
Which telephone number spent the longest time on the phone during the period?
Don't forget that time spent answering a call is also time spent on the phone.

Print a message:
"<telephone number> spent the longest time, <total time> seconds, on the phone during
September 2016.".

### Task 3
(080) is the area code for fixed line telephones in Bangalore.
Fixed line numbers include parentheses, so Bangalore numbers
have the form (080)xxxxxxx.)

Part A: Find all of the area codes and mobile prefixes called by people
in Bangalore.
 - Fixed lines start with an area code enclosed in brackets. The area
   codes vary in length but always begin with 0.
 - Mobile numbers have no parentheses, but have a space in the middle
   of the number to help readability. The prefix of a mobile number
   is its first four digits, and they always start with 7, 8 or 9.
 - Telemarketers' numbers have no parentheses or space, but they start
   with the area code 140.

Print the answer as part of a message:
"The numbers called by people in Bangalore have codes:"
 <list of codes>
The list of codes should be print out one per line in lexicographic order with no duplicates.

Part B: What percentage of calls from fixed lines in Bangalore are made
to fixed lines also in Bangalore? In other words, of all the calls made
from a number starting with "(080)", what percentage of these calls
were made to a number also starting with "(080)"?

Print the answer as a part of a message::
"<percentage> percent of calls from fixed lines in Bangalore are calls
to other fixed lines in Bangalore."
The percentage should have 2 decimal digits

### Task 4
The telephone company want to identify numbers that might be doing
telephone marketing. Create a set of possible telemarketers:
these are numbers that make outgoing calls but never send texts,
receive texts or receive incoming calls.

Print a message:
"These numbers could be telemarketers: "
<list of numbers>
The list of numbers should be print out one per line in lexicographic order with no duplicates.
